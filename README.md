# macos_setup

Config and installation backup for macOS

## Getting Started

To install setup in new machine, run:

`./install`

To backup setup, run:

`./backup` and then commit changes

To configure machine from setup, run:

`./pimp`

_Note: `install` runs `pimp` as the last step, so no need to run it after that_

## Do manually

- MacOS preference panel configs:
	- Dock position and size
	- Trackpad sensitivity
	- Scroll direction
	- App preferences
	- customize toolbar
	- See battery status and bluetooth status in bar
- Load Iterm2 configs from com.googlecode.iterm2.plist
